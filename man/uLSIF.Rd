\usage{
uLSIF(x, y, sigma = 10^seq(-3, 1, length.out = 9), lambda = 10^seq(-3, 1,
  length.out = 9), kernel_num = 100, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector or matrix as data from a numerator distribution p(x).}

\item{y}{numeric vector or matrix as data from a denominator distribution q(y).}

\item{sigma}{positive numeric vector as a search range of Gaussian kernel bandwidth.}

\item{lambda}{positive numeric vector as a search range of regularization parameter.}

\item{kernel_num}{positive integer as number of kernels.}

\item{verbose}{logical(default TRUE).}
}
\value{
uLSIF object that contains the function to estimate density ratio.
